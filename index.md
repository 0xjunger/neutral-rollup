We believe it’s time to build a rollup that doesn’t revolve around private token allocations or opaque governance. One that doesn’t require trust in a foundation, a multisig, or a VC round. One that can outlive all of us.

Why now?
Rollups have become the new L1s — controlled by a small group of insiders, guided by private incentives. We believe the Ethereum community deserves a public, neutral alternative.

Ethereum community has called for us to act. We’re responding with a plan to build and launch Ethereum One — and we want you to help shape it.
